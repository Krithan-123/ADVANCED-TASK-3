 **OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**PROJECT : API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION**

**OBJECTIVE:**
    This project's main goal is to convert unprocessed data into visually understandable representations. The project's goal is to make complex data easier to grasp by using sophisticated data visualization tools including interactive dashboards, graphs, and charts. Users can examine important metrics, trends, and patterns in real time with these visualizations. Users can get into particular details and examine various facets of the material by utilizing interactive elements.
    The goal of the data visualization and API integration project is to use API connections to access external data sources in order to collect data in real time. Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, serve as linkages between various systems, facilitating the effective access and use of data from a range of platforms, including social media, financial markets, and meteorological services. The project saves time and simplifies data collecting by integrating several APIs to guarantee that data from these various sources may be automatically obtained without human intervention.
    The ultimate goal of this project is to support users in making defensible choices by providing them with data-driven insights. The decision-making process is improved by the visualizations, which offer an easy way to keep an eye on significant indicators and trends. Users are empowered to swiftly understand information and keep current with pertinent data from multiple sources thanks to real-time data updates and aesthetically appealing dashboards, which increases productivity and promotes better decision-making.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**
- **PYTHON :** Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language used for web development, data analysis, automation, and more.
- **VSCODE :** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight, open-source code editor with support for debugging, version control, and extensions
- **Requests:** For fetching weather data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- **PANDAS :** Pandas is used for data analysis and manipulation, and it offers data structures like DataFrames to handle and analyze structured data effectively. It makes it simple to clean, transform, and explore data for activities involving analysis or machine learning.
- **SCIKIT-LEARN(sklearn):** A machine learning library called Scikit-learn offers easy-to-use and effective tools for data mining and analysis. It contains tools for model evaluation and preprocessing as well as algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering.
- **MATPLOTLIB :** Matplotlib is a plotting library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It allows users to generate a wide variety of charts and graphs to visualize data insights effectively.
- **SEABORN :** Seaborn is a Matplotlib-based data visualization library that offers a high-level interface for making visually appealing and educational statistics visualizations. It makes it easier to create intricate visualizations such as pair plots, box plots, and heatmaps.
